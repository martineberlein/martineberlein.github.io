I am a doctoral researcher and Ph.D. candidate in the Software Engineering group of [Prof. Lars Grunske](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/Members/lars-grunske) at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en), Germany. I previously collaborated with [Prof. Andreas Zeller](https://andreas-zeller.info)'s research group at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) in Saarbrücken.

My research focuses on automated software engineering, with an emphasis on software testing, vulnerability detection, and *fuzzing*. Currently, I am part of the **EMPEROR** project, which seeks to automatically generate *explanations for program behaviors*, particularly program failures. By leveraging predictive and generative models, we aim to uncover and refine relationships among input features, enhancing our understanding of how and why software behaves as it does.
