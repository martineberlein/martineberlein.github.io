 I co-founded <strong>InputLab</strong>, a startup that generates test data for various formats, from electronic invoices to communication between government authorities, covering all input features. We secured <strong>â‚¬900k in initial funding</strong> from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research! Visit us at <a href="https://inputlab.net">inputlab.net</a>.
