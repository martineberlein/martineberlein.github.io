I am honored to have been awarded the prestigious <strong>Black Shirt</strong> by my research group at Humboldt-Universit√§t Berlin for my contributions to the field of software engineering! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts_(American_football)">Blackshirt</a> tradition originates from the Nebraska University Football Team, where it is given to exceptional defense players for outstanding performances.
